# User Documentation

## Description

Baller is a web-based tool that helps you make smarter and safer purchasing decisions on peer-to-peer marketplaces. When you’re browsing listings, you often are forced to make quick decisions on limited information, making it hard to tell if the product is fairly priced or even legitimate. Baller's objective is to reduce that uncertainty for every user on these marketplaces. By analyzing a listing and comparing it with similar items across platforms (work in progress), our goal is to provide accurate market data and offer users a sense of relief when scrolling through listings. Using the data that we find in your listing and on the market, Baller gives users an estimate on item condition, recommends an offer based on current market trends, and highlights potential scam indicators (work in progress), allowing users to search freely and without worry.

## Getting Started

### What you need

To use Baller, you only need:

* A web browser

* A listing URL from a supported marketplace (copied from your browser’s address bar)

### Steps

1. Open the Baller web app.

2. Open the listing you want to analyze in a new tab.

3. Copy the browser URL from the address bar.
Note: This is different from the platform’s Share link. Use the image below as a reference.

4. Paste the URL into Baller and click Search.

### Creating an account (optional)

The intention of Baller is to push our users to create accounts. In future iterations we plan to implement it so that those who do want to utilize the app more then once will be pushed to create an account to do so. Creating an acount also has the benefit of storing a users most recent 25 analyzed listings for quick access later in the dashboard.

## Baller Basics

When building Baller, our goal was to keep it as simple as possible for every user. Follow the steps below to analyze a listing and understand your results.

### How to Use Baller

1. Paste a listing browser URL into Baller’s search bar.

2. Click search to load your listings analysis.

3. Review the listing details shown on the dashboard to confirm Baller analyzed the correct item.

### Understanding Your Dashboard

- **Suggested Offer**: A recommended price generated by our model that's both fair and competitive.

- **Model Accuracy**: How confident Baller is about the suggested offer we gave you. This is based on factors like how many comparable listings were found and how many listing photos could be analyzed.

- **Market Value**: Baller’s estimate of what the item is worth, based on various factors including condition and age.

- **Why this price?**: The explanation section that briefly describes why Baller suggested this offer, allowing for users to give these reasons to the seller.

- **Negotiation Tip**: A negotation tip that allows users quick advice on counter-offers and potential back-and-forth conversations.

- **Similar Listings**: Review the comparable items Baller used to make its estimate. Each listing includes a link so you can verify prices and see alternatives.

With these easy to follow steps, Baller lets you evaluate listings faster, make better offers, and shop with confidence.
