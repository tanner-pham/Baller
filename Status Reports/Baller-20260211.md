# Status Update: Finished Design ane Architecture, Working towards Beta Release (February 11th, 2026)

## Goals from Last Week:
Since the majority of planning has been completed, our team feels confident starting development. We will have a focus on testing and CI to meet milestone 4. With that in mind, our goals for the next week are:
- Drafting testing procedure (comepleted)
- Implementing testing framework (comepleted)
- Implementing CI service (comepleted)
- UI and design language finalised (comepleted)
- Scraping service development, for purpose of small scale testing (working)
- Documenting changes to the software after successful implementation (working)

## What got done:

We were able to complete all of our CI and testing goals along with finishing most of our frontend and working on the backend and connecting them.
- Drafted testing procedure
- Implementing testing framework
- Implementing CI service
- UI and design language finalised
Additionally
- Figma design
- Front end UI
    - Dashboard layout
    - Landing page layout
- Database set up and connection

## Progress and Issues:

### Improvements:
- We are currently working on frontend and backend communication now. Found an API to scrap the information and are learning how to connnect it to the backend. Additionally, figuring out how our model will estimage pricing.
- Preparing for the beta release and presenation
- Extracting images and text from listings and condition tagging.
- Expanding tet coverage

### New Learning:

This week was helpful in solidifying our full software stack and integrating the major components of our system.
- How to properly structure and enforce CI pipelines with coverage thresholds
- The importance of strict API response contracts between frontend and backend
- Supabase schema design considerations and relational modeling tradeoffs
- Testing strategies for isolating services (mocking vs integration testing)

### Emerging Issues:
- Managing consistency between frontend TypeScript types and backend response schemas required additional coordination. Ensuring consistent test coverage across both frontend and backend required refinement of test structure
- Overall, issues are manageble and we are working on them through the next couple days.

## High Level Goals:
Our high level goals are similar to the last couple weeks, with better detail given new developments:
- Create scraping system, *utilizing the backend to connect Supabase to scraping deployments*
- Create working model and fallback heuristics, *using cached information in the database when possible*
- Fully implement the front and backend to be fully functional with facebook marketplace
listings and optimize accuracy and speed.

## Goals for Next Week:
- Complete listing ingestion and scraping module (Tanner)
- Implement structured text + image extraction (Daniel)
- Begin condition tagging service (CLIP integration) (Daniel)
- Develop comparable listings retrieval pipeline (Nathan)
- Connect real backend data to dashboard (replace mock data) (Lamont)
- Expand test coverage for scraping + database layer (David)
- Prepare demo slides for milestone presentation (Christy)

## Questions for Product Leader:
- How formal is the beta release and realisticlly, how much substance should we have?
- Do you have any examples of beta releases from previous quarters?
