# `src/types` Code Map

Shared type declarations used by route handlers and build tooling.

| File | Purpose | Key Exports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/types/css.d.ts` | Allows TypeScript imports for CSS modules/files where needed. | module declaration for `*.css` |

## Notes

- Keep shared declaration files here to avoid duplicating type assumptions across route files.
